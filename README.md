# Shepherd's Mod for Vintage Story

## Description

The Shepherd's Mod is a modification (mod) for the Vintage Story game that adds a new tool called the Shepherd's Crook. This staff-like tool can be used to poke animals in the game, provoking them to become angry at the player without causing actual harm to the animal.

## Features

- Adds the Shepherd's Crook tool to the Vintage Story game.
- Allows players to interact with animals by poking them with the Shepherd's Crook.
- Provokes animals to become angry at the player without inflicting damage.

## Future Plans

While the mod currently only includes the Shepherd's Crook and the ability to provoke animals, there are plans to further enhance animal behavior modification in the future. Some potential ideas for future updates include:

- Snaring untamed animals.
- Shepherding tamed animals to follow the player in neat flocks.

Please note that these plans are subject to change, and updates will be released as development progresses.
